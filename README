Unscramble
==========

This is a Ruby script which prints solutions to the Word Scramble iPhone app by Zynga. When you run the script, you will be
prompted to input the board, left-to-right, top-to-bottom; the script will then recursively work through the network of possible
moves on the board, matching each word against an indexed dictionary array, abandoning branches as soon as they become unmatchable
by having no substring matches in the dictionary. Optimized to run in less than a second on most systems.



Example
=======

1. Run the script. You will receive a prompt.

2. Start Scramble.

3. Given the board: a s d f
                    z x c v
                    w e r t
                    y u i o

   input: asdfzxcvwertyuio

4. Get a ridiculous high score.



Caveats
=======

No support for 'Qu' yet. This was a quick project to help me destroy my friend's Scramble score and I didn't feel like
getting into it...

Also, cheating is bad.
